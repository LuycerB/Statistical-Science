This documentation offers insights into the use of Dynamic Nelson Siegel model with a Time-Varying Vector-AutoRegressive component to fit a model to forecast the Term Structure of Interest Rates for the short and long horizons.
Keywords; Bayesian Statistical Modelling, Dynamic Nelson-Siegel, TV-VAR models, Term Structure of Interest Rates.
