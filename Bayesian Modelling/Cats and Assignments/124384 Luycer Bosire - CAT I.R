#Q1: Single parameter poisson

#Consider the count of airline crashes per year over a 10-year period form 1976 to 1985:
  
y <- c(24,25,31,31,22,21,26,20,16,22)
#a. Show that the Gamma distribution is the conjugate prior for a Poisson mean.



#b. Show graphics of the resulting posterior distribution for choices of various gamma priors


#c. Show a table of the prior, MLE and posterior estimates of the poison mean (??) under different choices of the gamma priors in (a) above.



#Q2: CR and HPD
#a. Differentiate between Credible Intervals and the Highest Posterior Density (HPD) in Bayesian analysis.


#b. Graphically demonstrate this for a disease prevalence given that out of 150 individuals 18 had the disease. Hint: assume Binomial distribution
